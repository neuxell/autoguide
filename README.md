# overview
Automatically identifies all characters currently picked and banned. (Riot API does not provide pregame (lobby) stats.) Makes use of certain sites for the strategy findings. In the future, the Riot API will be implemented for my own special analytics.

# instructions
MOST IMPORTANT: Do not move your client window, or else this program will not be able to locate it (because it's less trouble to have you not move the window, vs. trying to find the window automatically)
open at any time, preferably before or during lobby selection. This way, you'll get live picking/banning tips (and strategems in the future, hopefully)
